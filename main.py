                    Elon Reeve Musk (born June 28, 1971) is a businessman, industrialist, and former public official who is the chief executive officer (CEO) and largest shareholder of Tesla and SpaceX.

Following its sale in 1999, he co-founded X.com, an e-commerce payment system that merged with Confinity in March 2000 to form PayPal, which was acquired by eBay in 2002.
